		Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised 
		as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that 
		in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're 
		actually proud of that shit.

		My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't 
		there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and 
		there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. 
		She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we 
		go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to 
		get shot. You understand?
